Hi there! Iâ€™m Will, a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate working with human behavior recognition focusing on emotion recognition. In my research, I develop methods to extract nonverbal cues that can be correlated with emotion and to understand which cues are important and how we can extract them. Many of these insights come from research on behavioral and cognitive psychology; however, many researchers would not be able to access this information, mainly due to the lack of time.

This is why I decided to create Behavioral Bites, a blog that offers bite-sized insights on human behavior analysis and suggestions on extracting nonverbal cues that can be correlated to emotion, activity, interaction, and other similar tasks. In this blog, we will discuss ideas, approaches, and also papers, providing easily digestible information.

See you all in a bit!
